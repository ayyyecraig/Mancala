# Mancala
Capture as many seeds in this two player turn base game! Fun filled strategy game that will keep you going round for round! 

## Rules of the Game. 

  Once played in the sands of ancient Eygpt, this game gives each player a storage to fill from your 6 "pits" loaded up with 4 "seeds". First player picks a pit from there side of the board and moves each seed into the following pit one by one. When the last stone is dropped; dependent on the placment the player will either pick the pit up and continue to move the seeds or Player 2 now takes control. If your seeds fall into your pit, you may pick up the seeds and continue moving them in the counter-clockwise motion and each time you have reached your storage, store a seed in there for safe keeping and move on. Once fallen into your opponets pits you they will follow the same pattern as you. If one of your pits is empty and your last single seed falls into with the opposings pit filled with seeds you will be granted to take every seed from said pit and store it into your own. A player wins once all their pits are empty, the seeds are counted form each storage; the player with the most seeds wins the game.


# Functions, Logic, and Appeal.

## Appeal
  Before moving onto the logic of the game, I first wanted to bring the simplist and purest form the game to a new digital age. Creating an old world Eygpt feel with the board placed directly into the sand itself.
